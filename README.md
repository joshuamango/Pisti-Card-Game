# Pişti

### Info:
*  Also known as [Bastra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bastra), Pişti is a Turkish card game that uses a standard 52—card deck
*  Cards are played to a central pile which can be captured by playing a card that matches the previous card or a [Jack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_(playing_card)).

### Why I made this:
  * This project was an assignment for a class called "Programming Principles II" that I took in the spring of 2018. In the class, we were allowed to choose from several potential projects. I chose a card game because I wanted to improve my ability to make graphical user interfaces and use object-oriented design techniques.
